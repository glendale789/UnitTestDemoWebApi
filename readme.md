# A Day with GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant that can help you write code faster and more efficiently. Here's how it can assist you throughout your day as a software developer.

## The Scrum:
In the scrum meeting, you've been assigned a new feature to implement. 

Task 1:
AS an internal weather api user, I need to be able to add new weather data to the api
SO that I can keep the weather data up to date. 

Bug 2:
InfoSec has reported 2 security vulnerabilities in the weather api - UnsafeServices class. They have identified that the api is not validating user input correctly and is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.  Need to address these vulnerabilities.


### Morning: Implement The Feature

GitHub Copilot can help you understand (/explain) the existing codebase and suggest code snippets to implement the new feature. 
As you write the code, GitHub Copilot can suggest code snippets to help you complete the feature more quickly.

Don't forget to add documentation (/doc) and error handling (one-shot prompting) to your code!
 

### Mid-Morning: Writing Unit Tests

GitHub Copilot can generate unit tests for your code. Simply write a comment describing the test you want to write, and GitHub Copilot will generate a test that matches your description.

### Afternoon: Secure The Code

GitHub Copilot can help you identify and fix security vulnerabilities (/fix) in your code. If you're not sure how to address a vulnerability, you can ask GitHub Copilot for suggestions.

### Late Afternoon: Time to Check In Code

GitHub Copilot can help you generate a pull request description. Simply write a comment describing the changes you've made, and GitHub Copilot will generate a pull request description that matches your description.


## Remember

GitHub Copilot is a tool to aid your development process, but it's not a replacement for understanding your code. Always review the suggestions before accepting them, as they might not always be the most efficient or secure solution.
